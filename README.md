# sws-wp-tweaks

This is a catch-all plugin for tweaks that I want to make to most or all of my sites. So far it includes the following, each of which can be separately turned on or off:

* Increase default max upload size
* Fix bug in password reset message
* Fix bug in iThemes Security font path
* Disable new user notifications
* Disable password change notifications
* Disable xml-rpc
* Add server tag to bottom of Home & About (blue- or green-)
* Fail validation for any Gravity Forms field containing HTML or non-English characters
* Code snippet for duplicating pages
* Styling (and shortcode) for automated accordions
* Custom logo/URL on login page
* Delete any users (below Author) who have not logged in for at least 60 days
* Ban user registrations from spammish domains/extensions
* Hide the default author page (which exposes usernames)
